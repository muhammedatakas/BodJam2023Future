# BodJam2023Future #Unity #2D #PlatformGame #PixelArt

In October 2023 I've attended a GameJam in Bodrum, MuÄŸla.
This is the fles of this 48 hours of marathon. This game is done in Unity

A simple puzzle game; where in a single map you find out the way and when you encounter an obstacle you should either go to future version of yourself and be athletic or  return to present and be a small litte child.

We simple use one scene per level and to change future/present; we change position of character and camera.

You can play it from here : https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webgl-builds-398050
